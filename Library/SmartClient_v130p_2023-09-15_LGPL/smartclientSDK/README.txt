Quick Start
----------------


1) Ensure that Java 2 Runtime or SDK 1.6 or higher is installed on
   your evaluation system (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp)*

   If you want to start without the built-in Java server, you can simply open 
   index.html form webRoot off your filesystem or deploy to your web server and 
   open from there, but note that the Feature Explorer and some standalone examples 
   will not work in this mode. You will be able to read the docs, however.


2) Run start_embedded_server.bat (Windows) .sh (*nix) or .command (MacOS)


3) Open your web browser (IE, Firefox, Mozilla, Netscape, or Safari)
   and browse to:
                      http://localhost:8080


4) Create a bookmark in your web browser to the URL:
                      javascript:isc.showConsole()
   for easy access to the SmartClient Developer Console


5) The SmartClient Quick Start Guide (PDF in smartclientSDK/docs/)
   covers common installation issues, and is your best starting point
   for an overview of the SmartClient SDK, system, and capabilities.



* The SmartClient AJAX RIA client is a pure-browser, zero-install
  system. The Java Runtime or SDK is required only to run the embedded 
  server and database, for convenient end-to-end examples and prototyping.
