//>	@class Timeline
// Timeline is a trivial subclass of +link{Calendar} that configures the Calendar with settings
// typical for a standalone timeline view: hides the +link{calendar.dayView, day}, 
// +link{calendar.weekView, week} and +link{calendar.monthView, month} tabs and the 
// +link{calendar.controlsBar, controls bar} by default.
// <P>
// Note that the +link{group:loadingOptionalModules, Calendar module} must be loaded to make 
// use of the Timeline class.
